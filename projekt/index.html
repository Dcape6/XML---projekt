                    <h2>Perez to continue as Red Bull driver after signing new two-year contract extension</h2><br>
                <img src="f1.jpg" title="f1">
    
    <p>Sergio Perez will continue as a Red Bull Racing driver through the 2026 season after the Milton Keynes team confirmed a multi-year extension to the Mexican’s contract.

        Perez’s existing deal – signed in 2022 – was set to expire at the end of the current campaign, but Red Bull have moved to keep him onboard for at least the next two terms.</p>
    
    <p>It comes amid a particularly busy driver market, with most outfits yet to confirm their full driver line-ups and plenty of conversations taking place behind the scenes.

        Perez, though, will be extending his stay at Red Bull into a landmark fifth season and beyond, having joined the squad from Racing Point – now Aston Martin – back in 2021.
        
        Since then, Perez has taken five Grand Prix victories – spread across 2021, 2022 and 2023 – and bagged three pole positions, claimed over the latter two years.</p>

                    <br><br><h2>Mercedes share how Hamilton intervened amid recent car upgrade dilemma</h2><br>
                    <img src="f2.jpg" title="f2"><br>
    
    
    
    <br><p>Lewis Hamilton suggested that George Russell should debut Mercedes’ latest upgrade at the Monaco Grand Prix, given only one set was available, according to the team’s Trackside Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin.

        In addition to a circuit-specific, high-downforce rear wing, Mercedes brought a new floor body and front wing to the streets of Monte Carlo, but the latter development was only sampled by Russell because just one set had been created.</p>
    
    <p>Mercedes’ post-Monaco Grand Prix debrief, Shovlin explained the thinking behind the decision, with both drivers previously raising the idea of splitting updates to learn as much as possible about the W15, though the situation did not arise until last time out in the Principality.

        Addressing why only Russell had the new parts, Shovlin said: “We are looking to have race quantities of that wing [for the next Grand Prix] in Montreal and normally you would say race quantities is at least three because you have got one for each car and then you have got a spare available should anything happen.</p>
    
    <p>“We do not make three in one go. We make the first, then the second, then the third. An upshot of that was that we had one that we could bring to Monaco and have it ready for Friday to do the weekend.

        “A while ago, the drivers asked why we always wait until we have got a full set. Why not just let one of us run it? We agreed with them that given the situation with the team in terms of performance, we need to improve, and we need to learn. It is quite good to have different specs on the car to do that.</p>
